# Financial Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent banking transactions using data analysis and machine learning techniques. It analyzes transaction patterns to identify anomalies and potential frauds to support secure financial operations.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Detect fraudulent transactions in banking data using supervised learning algorithms.
- **Tools Used:** Python, Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset:** Synthetic banking transaction data with labeled fraud instances.

## Project Structure

- `Fraud_Detection_Colab.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all data preprocessing, analysis, and model building.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `bank_transactions_data_2.csv`: Dataset used for training and evaluation.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
